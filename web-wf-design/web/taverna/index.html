<h1>Taverna Workflow Designer</h1>
Welcome to the Taverna Workflow Designer!
<p>
<a href="../taverna.html">Working Example</a>
<p>
This is a prototype designed to show how existing workflows can be connected together and run using Taverna's Command Line tool and later a Taverna server.
<p>
This is NOT a replacement for the Taverna workbench and its Workflow Editor but as a support to to go on top of pre existing workflows.
<p>
It is intended to hide much of the complexity required to build Taverna workflows including:
<ul>
	<li>Hides XML Splitters and Mergers.
	<li>Hides Cross and Dot product choices.
	<li>Hides complex beanshells
	<li>Hides looping
	<li>Avoid users having to decide which paramters are needed for a webservice.
</ul>
What it does do includes:
<ul>
	<li>Allow several workflows to be joined together.
	<ul>
		<li>Even when the output name in one workflow is not the same as the input name as another workflow.
	</ul>
	<li>Provides a simple GUI for running a workflow
</ul>
<h2>Current state/ Limitations</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Setting individual inputs is limited to workflows where all inputs are depth.0 or 1
	<ul>
		<li>Input can be as a String
		<li>Input can be from a URI
		<li>Lists of Strings can be entered.
		<li>File input is not yet supported
	</ul>
	<li>Baclava inputs are supported
	<ul>
		<li>From URI
		<li>File Baclava not yet supported
	</ul>
	<li>Baclava output is supported
	<ul>
		<li>As a URI
		<li>Fancy Baclava Viewer for displaying Baclava files in a Web browser
		<li>Baclava output from one workflow can be used as Baclava input for another workflow
		<ul>
			<li>If and only if the input port names are a subset (or equal to) the ouput port names.
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Individual output support by casting to String
	<li>List output supported by flattening lists of lists and casting to string
	<li>Only predefined workflows
	<ul>
		<li>This is mainly for security
		<li>Additional workflows can easily be added
	</ul>
</ul>
<h2>Future work outside of the ONDEX prototype</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Replace command line with Taverna Server
	<ul>
		<li>Settup issue this includes
		<li>Passing of security stuff from client to server
	</ul>
	<li>Uploading files from client to server.
	<li>Baclava key (input/ output) name - renamer
	<li>Fancy guis based on Baclava format
	<ul>
		<li>Creating a Baclava input file
		<li>Viewing a Baclava file
	</ul>
	<li>Automatic generation of WireIt module based on Workflow
	<ul>
		<li>With placeholders/ tips on how to add links and tooltips
	</ul>
	<li>Fancier handling of list of lists output (if required)
	<li>Security
	<li>User accounts
	<li>Scuffl 2 workflows
	<li>Taverna 1 workflows
	<li>Renaming and marketing
	<li>User documentation
	<li>Partial run/ ask for input/ Continued run prototype
</ul>
