        <h1>Taverna Lite Workflow Designer</h1>
        
        <p>Welcome to the <a href="../index.html">Taverna
            Lite Workflow Designer</a>! <!--<p>
                                        <a href="../taverna.html">Working Example</a>--></p>
        <p>The application is based on the <a href="../wireit.html">WireIt library</a>. For the latest WireIt code and their official documentation see the <a href="http://neyric.github.com/wireit/">WireIt Web site</a>.</p>

        <p>This is a prototype designed to show how existing workflows can be connected
            together and run using the Taverna Command Line Tool and later the Taverna Server.</p>

        <p>This is not a replacement for the Taverna Workbench and its workflow editor.</p>

        <p>Its intention is to hide much of the complexity required to build Taverna workflows
            including:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Hiding XML splitters and merges</li>

            <li>Hiding cross and dot product choices</li>

            <li>Hiding complex Beanshells</li>

            <li>Hiding looping</li>

            <li>Avoiding users having to decide which parameters are needed for a Web service</li>
        
        </ul>What it does include:

        <ul>
            <li>Allows several workflows to be joined together

                <ul>
                    <li>Even when the output port in one workflow is not the same as the input port
                        as another workflow</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Provides a simple GUI for running a workflow</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>For administrators and developers</h2><a href="developer.html">Documentation for
            administrators and developers</a> interested in installing the application, looking at
        the source code or extending the existing code.

        <h2>Current state and limitations</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Setting individual inputs is limited to workflows where all inputs are depth 0 or
                1

                <ul>
                    <li>Input can be a string</li>

                    <li>Input can be content downloaded from a URL</li>

                    <li>Input can be a list of strings</li>

                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Baclava input is supported (where Baclava file is available from a URL) for cases where all workflow inputs are specified in one Baclava file
            </li>

            <li>Baclava output is supported

                <ul>
                    <li>As a URL pointing to the raw Baclava document</li>

                    <li>Baclava Viewer is available for displaying Baclava content in a Web browser</li>

                    <li>Baclava output from one workflow can be used as Baclava input for another workflow, if and only if the input port names are a subset (or equal to) the output port names
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Individual output support by casting to a string</li>

            <li>List output supported by flattening lists of lists and casting to a string</li>

            <li>Only predefined workflows can be used as components to compose "wirings" 

                <ul>
                    <li>This is mainly for security and not to allow arbitrary workflows to be run</li>

                    <li>Additional workflows can easily be added by application administrators</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Possible future work</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Replace Taverna Command Line Tool with the Taverna Server
            </li>
            <li>Components should be proper Taverna components/nested workflows rather than the top level workflows 
                and we should combine one big workflow (currently the workflow is saved as WireIt "wiring" in JSON format) 
                that gets executed once rather than a number of small workflows that get executed separately</li>

            <li>Uploading input files for workflows from client to server</li>

            <li>When Baclava output is used as an input downstream - the port names have to match. Would be nice to be able to rename the ones not matching or to link them somehow</li>

            <li>Creating a Baclava input file from the UI
            </li>

            <li>Automatic generation of WireIt 'wirings' based on Taverna workflows

                <ul>
                    <li>With placeholders/ tips on how to add links and tooltips</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Better handling of list of lists (if required)</li>

            <li>Security</li>

            <li>User accounts</li>

            <li>Support for  Scufl 2 workflows</li>

            <li>Support for Taverna 1 workflows</li>

            <li>Partial run/ask for input/continued run</li>
        </ul>
