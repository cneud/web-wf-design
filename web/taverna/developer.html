        <h1>Target audience</h1>
        This document is destined for:
        <ul>
            <li>Developers who intend to extend the functionality of the software.

        <h1>Installation</h1>
        <h2>Code</h2>
        <h3>WireIt</h3>
        This tool depends on <a href="http://neyric.github.com/wireit/">WireIt</a> version 0.5.0.
        <p>
            All the required changes to WireIt are done using <a href="extensions.js">Extensions</a>.
            The reasons for these extensions are all documented with the code.

                                                                                                                The defaults in the container definitions can always be overwritten by specifying values in the language sections.
