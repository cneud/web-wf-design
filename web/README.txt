This work was developed as part of the Ondex (mainly) and NeISS projects 

and is using the WireIt JavaScript wiring library from 

http://neyric.github.com/wireit/ (version 0.5.0). 

This work is being taken over by the NeISS and BioVel projects.

See taverna/developer.html for ideas on how to take this work further.
